# Coursework 2 Question 3
This project reuses and modifies files from previous projects to find the best polynomial approximation to a function in the 2-norm.
The new file, BestL2Fit contains a class derived from AbstractApproximator, with a specialised constructor that also defines that quadrature rule used in the integration part of the process.
Again the Matrix and Vector files are NOT mine.
The driver file is and example of how the code is used, and performs approxiations on four functions.
